/**
 * Choice function - takes as constructor parameters t, u, base and map. t =
 * input type (a.k.a. type of the keys inside the HashMap that will be passed) u
 * = output type (a.k.a. type of the values inside the HashMAp that will be
 * passed) base = the function which will compare keys in order to return a
 * value map = HashMap that is passed that will live inside the function's body.
 * <p>
 * The Choice Function should take a value that is of the same type as the map's
 * keys and compare this value with each key. Depending on the base function, it
 * can then return the value associated with the picked key.
 * <p>
 * An example to illustrate - Choice Function receives a time stamp - 4PM. It
 * will then compare this context to each and every key in the map (say the map
 * has two keys which are intervals, 8AM-5PM and 5PM-8AM). Also, let's say our
 * base function is one which find the closest key and returns it. We can then
 * find the key which resembles most 4PM and return this key's value as output.
 * 
 * [8AM-5PM] => 1000 [5PM-8AM] => 500
 * 
 * In this case, the base function would return the key [8AM-5PM] and the
 * ChoiceFunction would send 1000 as output to the processor.
