/**
 * Processor chain that trains a classifier by associating a collection of
 * feature values computed by a processor &beta; on a window, to a
 * <em>class</em> computed by a processor &kappa; on a subsequent window.
 * <p>
 * <img src="{@docRoot}/doc-files/ClassifierTraining.png" alt="Processor chain">
 * <p>
 * The process can be illustrated in the figure above. In this workflow, a
 * first copy of the stream is trimmed from its first $t$ events (box #1);
 * a sliding window of $m$ events (box #2) is submitted to a {@link Classifier},
 * noted by &kappa; (box #3). This processor acts as an oracle, which
 * assigns a label to each successive window of width <i>m</i> inside
 * the stream. In a second copy of the stream, an arbitrary trend
 * is computed over a sliding window of <i>n</i> events by a trend processor &beta;
 * (boxes #4 and #5). This trend $a$ and the classification
 * <i>c</i> computed from &kappa; are combined into a tuple
 * (<i>a</i>,<i>c</i>) &in; <i>A</i> &times; <i>C</i>, where <i>A</i> is the
 * set of trends, and <i>C</i> is the set of possible categories returned by
 * &kappa;.
 * <p>
 * This stream of tuples is accumulated into a set (box #6), and this
 * set is submitted to an {@link UpdateClassifier} processor, represented 
 * by box #7. Upon receiving these tuples, the learning processor's task 
 * is to update a classification function 
 * <i>f</i> : <i>A</i> &rarr; <i>C</i>, which can be obtained 
 * from various means, such as the use of a machine learning algorithm. The 
 * output of this processor is therefore a stream of <em>classifiers</em>
 * (i.e. functions).
 * <p>
 * When represented as a single box, this processor used the following diagram:
 * <p>
 * <img src="{@docRoot}/doc-files/ClassifierTraining-box.png" alt="Processor">
 * <p>
 * @param beta The processor computing the trend over the window. This
 * corresponds to &beta; in the diagram
 * @param kappa The processor used as the oracle. This
 * corresponds to &kappa; in the diagram
 * @param uc A processor that updates a classifier based on the
 * feature/class pairs produced by &beta; and &kappa;
 * @param t The offset (in number of events) between the "feature" window
 * and the "class" window
 * @param n The width of the "class" window
 * @param m The width of the "feature" window
